Jukloud - A web-based audio player

1. Installing Jukloud Server

Before you can use Jukloud you need:
+ Python 2.6 or better (2.XX version)
+ Web.py (included in additional-libs folder)
+ eyeD3 (included in additional-libs folder)

To install these libs in Windows, you should install Python first,
unzip the libs in any directory and install them using the command
prompt:

Web.py -> $> python.exe setup.py install
eyeD3 -> $> python.exe setup.py.in install

In Linux you can use a package manager to find these packages.



2. Starting Jukloud Server

To start the server open a terminal and type:
$> python jukloud.py

The server will start in port 8080. You can specify another port:
$> python jukloud.py 1234



3. Scanning your music library

At this moment, Jukloud only will look for songs in ./static/songs
folder. You can either place your songs in this folder or use symlinks
to redirect your actual music folder to ./static/songs.

You can use subfolders and place any file in songs folder. Jukloud
will scan recursively all the subfolders and will add to its database
any mp3 file with correct ID3 info (artist/album/track/genre).

To scan for music, open a terminal and type:
$> python songsdb.py

If you add new songs in folder, you can type it again to refresh the
changes in Jukloud database. If you move or delete any file, you
should reset the database. To do this, open a terminal and type:
$> python songsdb.py reset


4. Using the web player

With the server running, you only have to open a browser and going to
Jukloud, (ie: localhost:8080). The browser should show the player.

You can filter your files by artist, album or genre. Clicking in 
"All albums", "All artist" or "All genres" reset the interface.

If you click in a song in the lower table, the player start playing it.
